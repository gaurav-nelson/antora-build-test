= Adding comments

Comments allow you to add text notes to violations, so that everyone in the team can check what is happening with a violation.

.Prerequisites

* To add and remove comments, you need a role with `write` permission for the resource you are modifying. For example, to add comments on violations, your role must have `write` permission for the `Alert` resource.
* To delete comments from other users, you need a role with `write` permission for the `AllComments` resource.

.Procedure

. Click *New* in the *Violation Comments* section header.
. Enter your comment in the comment editor. You can also add links in the comment editor. When someone clicks on the link in a comment, the linked resource opens in a new tab in their browser.
. Click *Save*.

All comments are visible under the *Violation Comments* section, and you can edit and delete comments by selecting *Edit* or *Delete* icon for a specific comment.
