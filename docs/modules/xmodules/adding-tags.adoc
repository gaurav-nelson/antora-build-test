.Prerequisites

* To add and remove tags, you need a role with `write` permission for the resource you are modifying. For example, to add tags on violations, your role must have `write` permission for the `Alert` resource.
* To delete tags from other users, you need a role with `write` permission for the `AllComments` resource.

.Procedure

. Select the drop-down menu in the *Violation Tags* section. Existing tags appear as a list (up to 10).
