When you install {product-title}, it creates:

* A namespace called `stackrox` and installs {product-title} and its components in that namespace
* `PodSecurityPolicy` and Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) objects for all components
* Additional labels on namespaces, for use in generated network policies
//TODO: Add link to generate network policies
* An Application CRD (if it does not exist)

Uninstalling {product-title} involves deleting all these items.
